Instructions for the Array Orientation Setup GUI
Todd Duncombe
Updated: 12/4/15

RECOMENDATIONS:
-We recommend analyzing a single slide at a time using this analysis code.
In which case, the best organization practice is creating a separate folder
for each unique slide to be analyzed.
    i.e. a slide folder may contain multiple proteins or antibodies on the
    same slide, either from multichannel fluorescense scan,
    or stripping and reprobing.
    
    This is not required. If analyzing multiple slides in parallel turn 
    'Array Match' off.

BEFORE USE:
-Organize the microarray images of interest into a new directory. (tif required)
    Often, different images will represent different proteins or antibodies on
    this same slide.

-Visually inspect the images (e.g. in imageJ) that the array section of 
    interest is visable and shared among all slides. Do not crop the array
    seciton 'tight', it should have >1 mm of space extra on all sides.

(1) 'SELECT DIRECTORY' (top left)
Select the directory containing the .tif files of interest. The path for
the selected directory will be displayed near the headure of the GUI. All
.tif files from the directory will be loaded in the file list box.

(2) Move files from 'FILE LIST' (left) to the 'FILES TO BE PROCESSED LIST' (right)
-Click on the files of interest to move them to files to be processed.
-Click 'ADD ALL' to quickly move all files.
-To remove files from 'files to be processed', simply click on them again 
in the files to be processed box.

(3) 'ADD FILES TO TABLE' (center of gui)
Once all files to be processed are in the correct box, click 'ADD FILES TO
TABLE'. This will update the file assignment table with these files. The
image sizes will be automatically loaded into the 'image size' column. If
buttons 'Array Match ON' or 'Auto Image Match ON' are on, they will be
automatically performed (described below).

(4) Type the file nicknames into the 'NAME' column on the table
Fill in file nicknames for all images (e.g. GFP, aGFP, ab-GFP, anti-GFP). 
There must be no duplicates. This facilitates easy/intuitive referencing of the
images & corresponding data later on. It's best to choose a notation and 
stay consitent between slides. (example below)

(5) set 'ARRAY-MATCH'
Array match sets the ROI constant for all images. It is recommended when you
want to compare protein expression from different markers in the same cell.
-If all images are of the same slide, set ARRAY-MATCH to '1'.
-If there are multiple slides being analyzed, matching slides slides should
have a matching numeric value. Non matching images should have a 0.
(example below)

(6) set 'IMAGE-MATCH'
Image Match identifies images that match in image dimensions and naming, to
reduce the number of alignment steps required. Each matching image set will
share a positive integer. Non matching images should have a 0.
(example below)

File Assignment Table Example:
FileName:                           Name:     Array Match:    Image Match:
date_slide1_scan1_gfp_bTub_488       gfp            1               1
date_slide1_scan1_gfp_bTub_555       bTUB           1               1
date_slide1_scan2_HER2_ERK_488       HER2           1               2
date_slide1_scan2_HER2_ERK_555       ERK            1               2
date_slide1_scan3_mTOR_488           mTOR           1               0
date_slide1_scan4_aACT_488           aACT           1               0

--- if multiple slides are being processed simultanously (not recommened)--
date_slide2_scan1_gfp_bTub_488       slide2_gfp     2               3
date_slide2_scan1_gfp_bTub_555       slide2_bTUB    2               3

(7) Set Image/Array Settings (REQUIRED)
'SCALE' - resolution of the the image, in microns per pixel
'WELL TO WELL LATERAL DISTANCE' - transverse pixel spacing between wells
'LANE LENGTH' - axial pixel spacing between wells

Note: 'LAST ACTION' (bottom of gui) is updated for (almost) all steps, this is the 
place to check if the operation performance of the GUI is perplexing.

OPTIONAL - ADVANCED USERS ONLY
(*) 'REFERENCE ARRAY'
Imports an array from a previously processed file for Array # '1' only.
Useful if analyzing a slide that was previously analyzed (e.g. for other proteins.)

(*) 'ADVANCED SETTINGS'
'MULTIDIRECTIONAL ROI GENERATION' - Creates a double ROI for each image (up
and down). Useful for multiple single cell fractionations.
'MINIMUM Y CROP OFFSET' - Minimum y crop offset around the array.
